-   The data structure you plan to use.
TBD- not sure about this one
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
I've created the html skeleton based on the wireframes. I plan to revisit the
lessons and fundamentals to implement javascript functionality.
-   How you plan to approach this project.
  I will approach this project methodically. I will focus on one task at a time
  rather than trying to think bigger picture. During the design I will think big,
  but once I start coding I will focus on the task at hand.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
  As a user, I would like to create and account so I can play a game.
  As a user, I want to be able to click on a square and input either x or o.
  As user, I want to be able to see what my opponent selects each turn so I can respond.
  As a user, I would like to be able to log out and change password so I can manage my account.
  As a user, I want to be able to play again after a game finishes so I can play another match.
  As a user, I want to validate moves so the app doesnt switch to oppenents turn.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
Similar to our last few trainings, I will plan to be aware of seperation of
concerns and have seperate files for various functionality (ex. api.js, events.js, etc)
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
  I will try to be creative with the styling of the squares and add pictures.
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
  I will commit and push to GitHub early and often so I can have versions stored.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
  Only if I can complete the MVP in the alloted time.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
